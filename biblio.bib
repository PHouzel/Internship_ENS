We also compare the time that the computer takes to carry out the integration with each scheme.

              Brain rhythms recorded
              in vivo
              , such as gamma oscillations, are notoriously variable both in amplitude and frequency. They are characterized by transient epochs of higher amplitude known as bursts. It has been suggested that, despite their short-life and random occurrence, bursts in gamma and other rhythms can efficiently contribute to working memory or communication tasks. Abnormalities in bursts have also been associated with e.g. motor and psychiatric disorders. It is thus crucial to understand how single cell and connectivity parameters influence burst statistics and the corresponding brain states. To address this problem, we consider a generic stochastic recurrent network of Pyramidal Interneuron Network Gamma (PING) type. Using the stochastic averaging method, we derive dynamics for the phase and envelope of the amplitude process, and find that they depend on only two meta-parameters that combine all the model parameters. This allows us to identify an optimal parameter regime of healthy variability with similar statistics to those seen
              in vivo
              ; in this regime, oscillations and bursts are supported by synaptic noise. The probability density for the rhythm’s envelope as well as the mean burst duration are then derived using first passage time analysis. Our analysis enables us to link burst attributes, such as duration and frequency content, to system parameters. Our general approach can be extended to different frequency bands, network topologies and extra populations. It provides the much needed insight into the biophysical determinants of rhythm burst statistics, and into what needs to be changed to correct rhythms with pathological statistics.},

The main aim of this paper is to develop a numerical method to perform the eﬀective computation of the phase advancement when we stimulate an oscillator which has not yet reached the asymptotic state (a limit cycle). That is, we want to extend the computation of the phase resetting curves (PRCs) (the classical tool to compute the phase advancement) to a neighborhood of the limit cycle, obtaining what we call the phase resetting surfaces (PRSs). To achieve this goal we ﬁrst perform a careful study of the theoretical grounds (the parameterization method for invariant manifolds and another approach using Lie symmetries), which allows us to describe the isochronous sections of the limit cycle and, from them, to obtain the PRSs. In order to make this theoretical framework applicable, we use the numerical algorithms of the parameterization method and other semianalytical tools to extend invariant manifolds; as a result, we design a numerical scheme to compute both the isochrons and the PRSs of a given oscillator. Finally, to illustrate this algorithm, we apply it to some well-known biological models and we include a discussion on diﬀerent biological and numerical aspects suggested by these examples.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
          Circuits of excitatory and inhibitory neurons can generate rhythmic activity in the gamma frequency-range (30-80Hz). Individual gamma-cycles show spontaneous variability in amplitude and duration. The mechanisms underlying this variability are not fully understood. We recorded local-field-potentials (LFPs) and spikes from awake macaque V1, and developed a noise-robust method to detect gamma-cycle amplitudes and durations. Amplitudes and durations showed a weak but positive correlation. This correlation, and the joint amplitude-duration distribution, is well reproduced by a dampened harmonic oscillator driven by stochastic noise. We show that this model accurately fits LFP power spectra and is equivalent to a linear PING (Pyramidal Interneuron Network Gamma) circuit. The model recapitulates two additional features of V1 gamma: (1) Amplitude-duration correlations decrease with oscillation strength; (2) Amplitudes and durations exhibit strong and weak autocorrelations, respectively, depending on oscillation strength. Finally, longer gamma-cycles are associated with stronger spike-synchrony, but lower spike-rates in both (putative) excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In sum, V1 gamma-dynamics are well described by the simplest possible model of gamma: A linear harmonic oscillator driven by noise.},

A proposed function of these oscillations is to control the flow of signals among anatomically connected networks. However, the nature of neural coding that may support selective communication that depends on oscillations has received relatively little attention. Here, we consider the role of multiplexing, whereby multiple information streams share a common neural substrate. We suggest that multiplexing implemented through periodic modulation of firing-rate population codes enables flexible reconfiguration of effective connectivity among brain areas.},

	abstract = {Neural activity is often low dimensional and dominated by only a few prominent neural covariation patterns. It has been hypothesised that these covariation patterns could form the building blocks used for fast and flexible motor control. Supporting this idea, recent experiments have shown that monkeys can learn to adapt their neural activity in motor cortex on a timescale of minutes, given that the change lies within the original low-dimensional subspace, also called neural manifold. However, the neural mechanism underlying this within-manifold adaptation remains unknown. Here, we show in a computational model that modification of recurrent weights, driven by a learned feedback signal, can account for the observed behavioural difference between within- and outside-manifold learning. Our findings give a new perspective, showing that recurrent weight changes do not necessarily lead to change in the neural manifold. On the contrary, successful learning is naturally constrained to a common subspace.},

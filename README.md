# Internship_ENS: Code done during a first year Master's at the Groupe for Neural Theory of École Normale Supérieure

AR2_final_plt.py: plot the final results of the AR2 model simulations

AR2_model_v2.py: final version of the AR2 simulation

AR2_plot_PRCs.py: plot the PRCs of the AR2 model for variously scaled initial limit cycles in order to get a weighted PRCs (unreported work)

computePRCs_WC.py: example code by Alberto Pérez-Cervera

data: contains the output, both txt and jpg

Heun_method.py: example code to learn how to use the Heun integration process

Hopf.py: purely mathematical model; system near a Hopf bifurcation => for training 

persistant_sodium.py: current work; use other methods to compute PRCs for a simple biophysical model of the neuron to compare with ours

plot_data.py: plot the comparison graph for the Wilson-Cowan model (cf Akam paper)

plot_phase.py: sanity check; plot evolution of variables of a certain system during integration to check if everything ok

quadratic_int_fire.py: quadratic integrate and fire model of a neuron; not usable since cut off values mean no limit cycle

SNIC.py: purely mathematical model; system near a saddle node bifurcation => for training 

stochasticPRC.py: training; stochastic PRC for a toy model

toy_model_v2.py: improved integration of the toy model

Wilson_Cowan_derivatives.py: plot the values of the x and y derivatives in the phase plane of the WC system

Wilson_Cowan_plots.py: plot results for the WC model with params from Akam paper

WilsonCowanv2-3.py: computing PRCs for the WC model with params from Akam paper
